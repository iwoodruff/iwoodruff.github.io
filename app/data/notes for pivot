Eyes of an Artist

Classically trained in illustration, Isaac Woodruff has been drawing, sculpting and crafting his fancies since he was old enough to hold a pen.

To all his tasks he brings the same creativity, resolution, and meticulous attention to detail that he employs in the pursuit of his artwork.




Mind of a Nerd

Thoroughly steeped in fantasy, history, science, and mythology, Isaac Woodruff draws inspiration from a broad pallet of studies.

It is telling that one of Isaac Woodruff's most proud memories is when, while building exhibits at the Museum of Natural History, Neil Degrasse Tyson accidentally spilled a drink on his shirt.




Hands of a Coder

Isaac Woodruff approaches his code as he approaches all his passions: boundlessly curious, lusty for creation, meticulously attuned to minute details, and constantly in search of learning and growth.

As a Junior Full Stack Developer at a New York City Design and Development shop, Isaac Woodruff is engrossed daily in all aspects of code - both building new websites and applications as well as maintaining and updating a robust code-base.

He is available for freelance projects - especially flashy splash pages like this - as well as for commissioned artwork.
